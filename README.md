- ### Machine Learning

	- [Predicting Boston Housing Prices](https://github.com/sajal2692/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/boston_housing/boston_housing.ipynb): A model to predict the value of a given house in the Boston real estate market using various statistical analysis tools. Identified the best price that a client can sell their house utilizing machine learning.
	- [Supervised Learning: Finding Donors for CharityML](https://github.com/sajal2692/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/finding_donors/finding_donors.ipynb): Testing out several different supervised learning algorithms to build a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000, to identify likely donors for a fictional non-profit organisation.
	- [Unsupervised Learning: Creating Customer Segments](https://github.com/sajal2692/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/customer_segments/customer_segments.ipynb): Analyzing a dataset containing data on various customers' annual spending amounts (reported in monetary units) of diverse product categories for discovering internal structure, patterns and knowledge.
	- [Reinforcement Learning: Training a Smartcab to Drive](https://github.com/sajal2692/Training-a-Smartcab-to-Drive): Creating an optimized Q-Learning driving agent that will navigate a Smartcab through its environment towards a goal.
	- [Deep Learning: Digit Sequence Recognition using CNNs](https://github.com/sajal2692/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/digit_recognition-mnist-sequence.ipynb):  Designing and implementing a Convolutional Neural Network that learns to recognize sequences of digits using synthetic data generated by concatenating images from MNIST.
